cheese_tomato_omelette_description = "To make this cheese and tomato omelet, you need to beat four eggs in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Heat some butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and pour in the egg mixture. Cook for about 5 minutes, lifting the edges with a spatula to let the uncooked egg flow underneath. Sprinkle some shredded cheddar cheese and chopped cherry tomatoes over half of the omelet. Fold the other half over the filling and cook for another 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted. Cut into wedges and serve hot or cold."
